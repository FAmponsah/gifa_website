      <p>The Ghana & Ireland Friendship Association (GIFA) was formed in Limerick on 6th March 2005 and was registered in May 2005 with the Revenue Commissioners. The association is a non-profit making organisation and has no political or religious affiliations. Membership of the Association is open to all Ghanaians, Ghanaians with dual nationality or Irish Nationals and other nationals living in the Republic of Ireland, who agree with the aims and objectives of the association.        </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As a relatively and recently established association, GIFA primary focus is integration of Ghanaians into the Irish society. The association is visiting local schools and also participating in all community fairs programmes within counties Clare and Limerick. 
        The objective is to enhance a better understanding of the diversity of cultural in contemporary Ireland. As part of our work the association is actively involved in the community in ways that positively enhance and strengthen  cultural differences. This is done through our outreach programmes to schools as the way of reaching out to the locals especially the future generation of Ireland. Ghana and Ireland has a lot in common as both countries are noted for being friendly. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>History tells us that, friendship between Ghana and Ireland dates back to the early 20th century, through the work of early missionaries especially within the Roman Catholic Church with particular emphasis on the development of mission schools and hospitals in Ghana. 
        The work of the ESB rural electrification project in Ghana through the World Bank funding also brought a closer cooperation between the two countries. Various  exchange programmes now exist between schools in Ghana and Ireland. The recent discovery of oil in Ghana by Tullow Oil, an Irish based company firm is another testimony of contemporary bi-lateral relation between Ghana and Ireland. GIFA is seeking to build on the existing links of the two countries and keen to establish new partnership programmes between the two counties. </p>
